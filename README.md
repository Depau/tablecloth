My wayland/sway GUI tools, written in moder c++

I don't have any plans to make theese configurable, but i do plan to keep it fairly easilly forkable, so they can be used as starting points for other people's customizations.

Contributions welcome! - have fun

 - Support for icons, actions, urgencies, and replacing notifications
 - compatible with sway, and anything else that supports the layer_shell protocol
 - written in C++, drawn using GTK
 - Very little code, so should be easy to extend/modify to your liking.
